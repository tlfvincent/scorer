SCORER 2.0
======

This package contains the functions necessary to run the SCORER 2.0 algorithm. SCORER 2.0 can be used to differentiate between parallel dimeric and trimeric coiled-coil sequence, which are the two most more frequent coiled-coil structures observed naturally. As such, SCORER 2.0 is particularly useful for researchers looking to characterize novel coiled-coil sequences. It may also be used to assist in the structural characterization of synthetic coiled-coil sequences. Also included in this package are functions that allows the user to retrain the SCORER 2.0 algorithm using user-defined training data.
